# Great Loop Books — greatloopbooks.com

A Jekyll site for Great Loop book recommendations, organized by region, category, and reading level. Managed with GitHub + Obsidian, deployed automatically to GitHub Pages.

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup (One-Time)

### 1. Create the GitHub repo

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Name it `greatloopbooks` (or whatever you like)
3. Set it to **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
4. Don't initialize with README (you already have files)

### 2. Push this folder to GitHub

```bash
cd greatloopbooks
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial site"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/greatloopbooks.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repo → **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
3. The site will build automatically on every push

### 4. Connect your custom domain

1. In **Settings → Pages**, enter `greatloopbooks.com` under Custom Domain
2. At your domain registrar (wherever you bought greatloopbooks.com), add these DNS records:

```
Type: A     Name: @     Value: 185.199.108.153
Type: A     Name: @     Value: 185.199.109.153
Type: A     Name: @     Value: 185.199.110.153
Type: A     Name: @     Value: 185.199.111.153
Type: CNAME Name: www   Value: YOUR-USERNAME.github.io
```

DNS changes take up to 48 hours to propagate.

## 📖 Adding a New Book

1. In Obsidian, create a new file in the `_books/` folder
2. Name the file with the book's slug, e.g. `my-new-book.md`
3. Copy the frontmatter template from `_books/TEMPLATE-README.md`
4. Fill in what you know — not everything is required
5. Save and commit to GitHub — the site rebuilds automatically

### Minimum required frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: "Book Title"
summary: "One sentence description."
categories:
  - memoirs
amazon_url: "https://amzn.to/XXXXX"
---
```

### Your Amazon affiliate tag:
Set once in `_config.yml`:
```yaml
amazon_affiliate_tag: "greatloopbooks-20"
```
Update all Amazon links to use short affiliate URLs from your Associates dashboard.

## 📅 Setting the Featured Book of the Month

**Manual approach** — set `featured: true` on any book. Those books always show in the Featured section.

**Auto by month** — set `featured_month: "2026-04"` on a book and it will automatically be highlighted during April 2026. Set multiple books with the same month to feature 2–3 at once.

The homepage uses whichever method finds books first:
1. Month-specific books (`featured_month` matches current month)
2. Fallback: all books with `featured: true`

---

## 🔖 Adding Bookshop.org (When Ready)

1. Sign up at [bookshop.org/affiliates](https://bookshop.org/affiliates)
2. For each book, find its Bookshop.org URL and add it to the `bookshop_url` field
3. The "Buy on Bookshop.org" button will automatically appear on those book pages

---

## 🖼️ Cover Images

Best options (in order of ease):

1. **Open Library** — `https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/[ISBN]-L.jpg`  
   Free, no permission needed. Works for most books with an ISBN.

2. **Local file** — save to `assets/images/books/filename.jpg`, then use `/assets/images/books/filename.jpg`

3. **Amazon Product Advertising API** — official API access to Amazon images. More setup, but great for a book-focused affiliate site.

## Run it locally

Here are the exact commands to run from inside your `greatloopbooks` folder:

**First time only — install dependencies:**
```bash
bundle install
```

**Start the local server:**
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open **http://localhost:4000** in your browser.

---

**Useful variations:**

```bash
# Auto-rebuild when you save files (watches for changes)
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

# If port 4000 is already in use
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4001

# Show more detail if something errors
bundle exec jekyll serve --verbose
```

---

**If you don't have Ruby/Jekyll installed yet**, here's the one-time setup depending on your OS:

**Mac:**
```bash
# Install Homebrew if you don't have it, then:
brew install ruby
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
gem install bundler
```

**Windows:**
Download and run the RubyInstaller from [rubyinstaller.org](https://rubyinstaller.org) — use the "Ruby+Devkit" version. Then in a new terminal:
```bash
gem install bundler
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential
gem install bundler
```

---

Once `bundle exec jekyll serve` is running, any time you edit and save a `.md` book file or a layout, Jekyll rebuilds automatically and you just refresh the browser to see changes. The `--livereload` flag even does the refresh for you automatically.
